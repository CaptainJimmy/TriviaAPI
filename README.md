# Game of Throne Trivia
This is a basic trivia game built to use javascript, timers, jquery, and object arrays to store data. The layout is bootstrap. 
The question order is static, and the answers are static as well, however are dynamically created in jquery for each question to allow for multiple choice and true/false type questions. 

The theme is Game of Thrones.
